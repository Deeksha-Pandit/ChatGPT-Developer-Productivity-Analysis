# ChatGPT-Developer-Productivity-Analysis

The objective of this assignment is to explore the capabilities and limits of ChatGPT in enhancing 
developer productivity in a multitude of ways.

A. Writing Python code 

Describe a simple NLP coding task and ask ChatGPT to write the corresponding code in Python. Now 
successively ask ChatGPT to add more functionality to the code. At what level does ChatGPT writes 
incorrect code or is unable to handle any more complexity? 

B. Improving Python code

Write a piece of Python code for NLP in a deliberately sloppy way, and ask ChatGPT to improve the code. 
If it succeeds, increase the code complexity and analyze the extent to which ChatGPT is still able to 
improve it. 

C. Explaining Python code

Give ChatGPT a Python script for NLP and ask it to explain what the code does. If it succeeds, 
successively increase the code complexity and analyze ChatGPTâ€™s explanatory capabilities. 

D. Debugging Python code

Give ChatGPT a non-working Python script for NLP and ask it to debug. As in A, B, and C, make it 
successively more difficult and analyze where ChatGPT is unable to fix the code. 

E. Discuss the level of competence you observed for ChatGPT with the four tasks (A-D) above. 
E.g., 
is it better than that of a novice? An expert? What are the areas of improvement in ChatGPT in 
the above tasks to perform them in a real-world enterprise setting? How could it be 
accomplished?
